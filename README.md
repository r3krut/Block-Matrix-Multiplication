 <h1>Implementation of block matrix multiplication</h1>
 

<p> This is impementation of block matrix multiplication consists from 3 types</p>

<ul>
 <li>Sequential block multiplication</li>
 <li>Internal parallelization of two blocks</li>
 <li>External parallelization of sycle of multiplication</li>
</ul>

<p>Internal and external parallelization based on OpenMP technology</p> 
<br>

<p> This repository contains the results of the tests for GCC compiler for two different types: double and float, respectively</p>
<p> Later will be given the results of the tests for the Clang compiler or other</p>
